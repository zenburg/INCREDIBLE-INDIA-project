                   <p> Bihar covers a total area of 94,163 km2 (36,357 sq mi), with an average elevation above 
                     sea level of 173 feet (53 m). It is dominated by a vast stretch of fertile plain which is divided unevenly
                      by the Ganges River. Central parts of Bihar have some small hills, such as the Rajgir hills.
                      Though the foothills of the Himalayas begin in Nepal, a short distance to the north,
                      these mountains influence Bihar's landforms, climate and hydrology. 
                      Along with the Chota Nagpur plateau in Jharkhand to the south, these give Bihar a diverse climate. 
                      Its temperature is subtropical in general, with hot summers and cold winters.</p>

                   <p>Mithila gained prominence after the establishment of the Videha Kingdom. 
                     During the late Vedic period (c. 1100–500 BCE), Videha became one of the major 
                     political and cultural centers of South Asia, along with Kuru and Pañcāla. 
                     The kings of the Videha Kingdom were called Janakas. 
                     Sita, a daughter of one of the Janaks of Mithila is mentioned as the consort of Lord Rama, 
                     in the Hindu epic Ramayana, written by Valmiki.
                     The Videha Kingdom later became incorporated into the Vajji confederacy which had its capital in the city of Vaishali, 
                     which is also in Mithila.Vajji had a republican form of government where the king was elected from the rajas. 
                     Based on the information found in texts pertaining to Jainism and Buddhism, Vajji was established as a republic by 
                     the 6th century BCE, before the birth of Gautama Buddha in 563 BCE, making it the first known republic in India

                <td><h2>Cultural</h2>
                    <p>There are several traditional styles of painting practiced in Bihar. 
                      One is Mithila painting, a style used in the Mithila region of Bihar. 
                      Traditionally, this form was practiced mainly by women, passed down generation to generation. 
                      Painting was usually done on walls during festivals, religious events, births, marriages, and other cultural milestones.
                      It was traditionally done on the plastered walls of mud huts, and is also done on cloth,handmade paper and canvas.
                      Famous Mithila painters include Smt Bharti Dayal, Mahasundari Devi, the late Ganga Devi, and Sita Devi.
                      Mithila painting is also called Madhubani art. It mostly depicts human beings and their association with nature.
                      Common scenes illustrate deities and Saraswati from ancient epics, celestial objects, and religious plants like Tulsi, and scenes
                      from the royal court and social events. Generally, no space is left empty.
