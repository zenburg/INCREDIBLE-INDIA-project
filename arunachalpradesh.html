In Arunachal Pradesh, geography states that the region is divided into six natural regions. The Western parts of Kameng District and Tirap District form the first two regions of the topography of Arunachal Pradesh.

The other three distinct topographical regions of the geography at Arunachal Pradesh constitute the upper, middle and the lower belts of the state; concentrated pockets of the Arunachal Pradesh foothills form the sixth region of the topography of Arunachal Pradesh.

Further, it can be said that the topography of Arunachal Pradesh is characterized by mountainous ranges and sub-mountainous terrains along the northern parts: abrasion by the mighty rivers that flows through the mountains have created broad valley, which is a major feature of the geography in Arunachal Pradesh.</span></p>
