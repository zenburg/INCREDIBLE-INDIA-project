                Culture of Tripura is similar to those of Native indigenous tribal people of Northeast India. However like Assam, Manipur, Burma and Southeast Asia culture of Tripura is characterized in small portion living in plain areas by mainstream Indian cultural influence spearheaded by Bengali culture dominating over indigenous tribal traditional practices specially living in those plain areas, not much extending to hill people of Tripura notably the Tripuri culture. Tripura is a state in North East India. In the 2001 census of India, Bengalis represented almost 70% of the population and the tribal population comprised 30% of Tripura's population .The tribal population (indigenous population) comprises several different tribes and ethnic groups with diverse languages and cultures. The largest tribal group was the Kokborok-speaking tribe of the Tripuri who had a population of 543,848 in 2001 census,[1] representing 16.99% of the state population and 54.7% of the scheduled tribe population.[1] The other major tribes in order of decreasing population were Debbarma (16.6% of the tribal population), Jamatia (7.5%), Chakma (6.5%), Halam (4.8%), Mog (3.1%), Munda, Kuki tribes and Garo Hajong.[1] Bengali is the most spoken language, due to the dominance of Bengali people in the state. Kokborok is a common language among many tribes. Several other languages belonging to Indo-European and Sino-Tibetan families are spoken by the different tribe
