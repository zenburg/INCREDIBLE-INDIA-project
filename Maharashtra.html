                   <p> Maharashtra occupies the western and central part of the country and has a long coastline stretching
                      720 kilometres along the Arabian Sea. One of the more prominent physical features of Maharashtra is 
                      the Deccan plateau, which is separated from the Konkan coastline by 'Ghats'.The Ghats are a succession
                       of steep hills, periodically bisected by narrow roads. Most of the famous hill stations of the state 
                       are at the Ghats. The Western Ghats (or the Sahyadri Mountain range) provide a physical backbone to the
                      state on the west, while the Satpura Hills along the north and Bhamragad-Chiroli-Gaikhuri ranges on the
                      east serve as its natural borders. The state is surrounded by Gujarat to the north west, Madhya Pradesh to
                       the north, Chhattisgarh to the east, Telangana to the south east, Karnataka to the south and Goa to the southst.</p>

                   <p>Maharashtra was ruled by the Maurya Empire in the fourth and third centuries BCE. Around 230 BCE,
                      Maharashtra came under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty for 400 years. The greatest ruler 
                      of the Satavahana dynasty was Gautamiputra Satakarni. In 90 CE, Vedishri, son of the Satavahana
                       king Satakarni, the "Lord of Dakshinapatha, wielder of the unchecked wheel of Sovereignty", 
                       made Junnar, 30 miles north of Pune, the capital of his kingdom. The state was also ruled by Western
                       Satraps, Gupta Empire, Gurjara-Pratihara, Vakataka, Kadambas, Chalukya Empire, Rashtrakuta Dynasty, 
                       and Western Chalukya before finally, the Yadava rule. The Buddhist Ajanta Caves in present-day Aurangabad
                        display influences from the Satavahana and Vakataka style.
