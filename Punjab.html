                      the northeast and Haryana and Rajasthan on the south. Most of the Punjab lies in a fertile, 
                      alluvial plain with many rivers and an extensive irrigation canal system. A belt of undulating hills
                       extends along the northeastern part of the state at the foot of the Himalayas. Its average elevation is
                       300 metres (980 ft) above sea level, with a range from 180 metres (590 ft) in the southwest to more than 
                       500 metres (1,600 ft) around the northeast borde

                   <p>During the period when the epic Mahabharata was written, around 800â€“400 BCE, Punjab was known as Trigarta
                      and ruled by Katoch kings. The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of the Punjab region with cities such 
                      as Ropar. The Vedic Civilization spread along the length of the Sarasvati River to cover most of northern 
                      India including Punjab. Sikhism originated in the Punjab Region during the 15th century. 
                      Approximately 75% of the total Sikh population of the world lives in Punjab.
