                <h1>History of West Bengal</h1>
               Stone Age tools dating back 20,000 years have been excavated in the state, showing human occupation 8,000 years earlier than scholars had thought.[44] According to the Indian epic Mahabharata the region was part of the Vanga Kingdom.[45] Several Vedic realms were present in the Bengal region, including Vanga, Rarh, Pundravardhana, and the Suhma Kingdom. One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is a mention by the Ancient Greeks around 100 BCE of a land named Gangaridai located at the mouths of the Ganges.[46] Bengal had overseas trade relations with Suvarnabhumi (Burma, Lower Thailand, the Lower Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra).[47] According to the Sri Lankan chronicle Mahavamsa, Prince Vijaya (c. 543 – c. 505 BCE), a Vanga Kingdom prince, conquered Lanka (modern-day Sri Lanka) and named the country Sinhala Kingdom.[48]

               The kingdom of Magadha was formed in the 7th century BCE, consisting of the regions now comprising Bihar and Bengal. It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of the lives of Mahavira, the principal figure of Jainism, and Gautama Buddha, founder of Buddhism. It consisted of several janapadas, or kingdoms.[49] Under Ashoka, the Maurya Empire of Magadha in the 3rd century BCE extended over nearly all of South Asia, including Afghanistan and parts of Balochistan. From the 3rd to the 6th centuries CE, the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the Gupta Empire.[.

                Tourism in West Bengal refers to West Bengal's tourism. West Bengal is a state in the eastern region of India and is the nation's fourth-most populous.[1] The state capital is Kolkata. The state encompasses two broad natural regions: the Gangetic Plain in the south and the sub-Himalayan and Himalayan area in the north. The tourism in West Bengal is maintained by WBTDCL, a state government owned enterprise.

                West Bengal, located on eastern bottleneck of India stretching from the Himalayas in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south, presents some of marvelous landscape features and natural scenic beauty. Some of India's most preferred travel destinations like; the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region in the northern extreme of the state, the highest peak of the state Sandakphu (3,636 m or 11,929 ft)[2] and the Sundarbans mangrove forests in the extreme south.


                During the British colonial era from 1700–1912, Kolkata enjoyed the privilege of being the capital of British India and witnessed a spate of frenzied construction of buildings, largely influenced by the conscious intermingling of Neo-Gothic, Baroque, Neo-Classical, Oriental and Islamic schools of design. Unlike many north Indian cities, whose construction stresses minimalism, the layout of much of the architectural variety in Kolkata owes its origins to European styles and tastes imported by the British and, to a much lesser extent, by the Portuguese and French.

                Currently Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan is the brand ambassador of West Bengal Tourism. The promotional films on West Bengal starring Shah Rukh Khan have been directed by Indian National Award winning filmmaker Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury

                The Bengali language boasts a rich literary heritage it shares with neighbouring Bangladesh. West Bengal has a long tradition of folk literature, evidenced by the Charyapada, a collection of Buddhist mystic songs dating back to the 10th and 11th centuries; Mangalkavya, a collection of Hindu narrative poetry composed around the 13th century; Shreekrishna Kirtana, a pastoral Vaishnava drama in verse composed by Boru Chandidas; Thakurmar Jhuli, a collection of Bengali folk and fairy tales compiled by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumder; and stories of Gopal Bhar, a court jester in medieval Bengal. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Bengali literature was modernised in the works of authors such as Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, whose works marked a departure from the traditional verse-oriented writings prevalent in that period;[188] Michael Madhusudan Dutt, a pioneer in Bengali drama who introduced the use of blank verse;[189] and Rabindranath Tagore, who reshaped Bengali literature and music. Indian art saw the introduction of Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[190] Other notable figures include Kazi Nazrul Islam, whose compositions form the avant-garde genre of Nazrul Sangeet,[191] Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, whose works on contemporary social practices in Bengal are widely acclaimed,[192] and Manik Bandyopadhyay, who is considered one of the leading lights of modern Bengali fiction.[193] In modern times, Jibanananda Das has been acknowledged as "the premier poet of the post-Tagore era in India".

                West Bengal has a tropical climate. The plains are hot except during the short winter season. The mountanious region in the north is cold. On account of its altitude but there humidity is high. The classical tradition speaks of six seasons-Spring, Summer, the rainy, Autumn, mild Winter and severe Winter. Only four clearly marked seasons with a brief interregnum of spring are observed, namely the hot season, the rainy season, the post monsoon season corresponding to autumn and the cold season. The hot season lasts from mid-March to mid-June, with the day temperature ranging from 38o C to 45oC in different parts of the state. At nights, a cool southerly breeze carrying moisture from the Bay of Bengal is usually present. The high temperature often causes troughs of low pressure to form on the plains which are compensated by sudden briefs storms known as kal-baisakhi or 'nor-westers', accompanied by thunder showers. These summer storms can be quite destructive. The hills of Darjeeling district are pleasantly cool in summer, the higher reaches are sometimes enveloped in heavy fog. On some days, one is rewarded by the sight of the majestic snow-girt Kanchanjunga and the eastern Sikkim ranges and the greenness of the wooded hills and gorges that abound on all sides.

                The monsoon arrives by a middle of June. Its scouts start arriving about two weeks before its normal onset. This is called the Chhota monsoon which breaks the hot spell  of summer. The monsoon rains in west Bengal are caused solely by the current of wind from the Bay of Bengal.A welcome change in the weather begins to be distinctly felt towards the end of September. Autumn in West Bengal is the season for festivity in the fields the golden grain of paddy starts ripening and is harvested towards the end of the season. The conclusion of the round of the festivities marks the onset of the winter in mid-November.
