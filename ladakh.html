                Over the years, writers and travelers have been unable to resist employing the term Shangri La to describe the remote land of Ladakh, in northern India. Yet, at a glance, this region of the Tibetan Plateau seems an unlikely paradise. The soaring Himalayas, which define Ladakh on the south, prevent all but about four inches of annual precipitation from reaching the area. The base elevation is around 11,000 feet, with the mountains reaching 20,000 feet and higher. During the seven-month winter, it is not uncommon for temperatures to drop to -40°F. In summer, the high altitude sun beats down mercilessly. Scarcely any vegetation softens the lines of the jagged mountains.

But tucked in the valleys among these barren mountains are villages which testify to a life of abundance rather than scarcity. Startlingly green terraced fields of barley, wheat and vegetables surround large, elegant houses of adobe and hand-carved wood. Like their beautiful communities, the friendly faces and the tolerant, generous manner of the Ladakhi people radiate a sense of plenty and satisfaction.

Through their intimate understanding and ingenious use of scarce natural resources, these people have for centuries succeeded in providing for all their basic needs. And they have done so without undermining the integrity of their natural environment, without treating nature as an adversary to be conquered. Nor do the Ladakhis interact competitively with each other. Their way of life is characterized by cooperation - within the extended family and throughout the village. The young learn from and help the old, and there is little rigidity in the division between the work and privileges of women and men. Life in Ladakh is infused with great stability and peacefulness. Crime and poverty are virtually unknown.

While there is no denying that life in Ladakh involves hard work, the people enjoy a substantial amount of leisure, highlighted by lengthy and elaborate weddings, funerals and religious celebrations. Their culture is rich and colorful, centering around the beliefs and practices of Tibetan Mahayana Buddhism, the predominant religion.

                <h1>History of Ladakh</h1>
                 the history of the Ladakh started getting documented right after the 7th and 8th century. In the 7th and 8th century, Tibetanization of Ladakh began. Even today, people believe that Ladakh is a part of the Tibet. By the end of the 9th century, the Tibetan culture started heavily influencing the major developments in Ladakh. Tibetans kept on playing the role of the major key players till the 9th century. The rulers of Tibet. Yarlung Dynasty kept a strong hold on the Tibet boundaries. Then an Islamic kingdom allied itself with China, which made Tibet stop its military expansion. Then Ladakh came under the control of Ralpacan, a strong king, and devout Buddhist. He initiated many measures to support Buddhism. After his assassination, Ralpacan's brother Lang Darma came into power and gained a large following in Tibet. Some years later, after the demise of Lang Darms, the population of Buddhist started reducing. Ultimately, Ladakh became an independent kingdom under the rule of a local ruler.

In the 10th century, the Lha Chen Palgyi-Gon, a descendant of Lang Darma came into power. During his tenure, major cultural and religious practices were initiated. Later in 1553, Namgyal Dynasty, conquered Ladakh. They kept their rule over Ladakh until the 17th century. In the Namgyal Dynasty, Singe Namgyal was the most important leader who ruled Ladakh in the 17th century. He was known by the name of "Lion King,".and was noted was his contribution in making palaces, monasteries and shrines

After the death of Singe Namgyal, his area was divided and given a name - Ladakh. Then it eventually passed to his successor, Deldan Namgyal (ca. 1675-1705). During his rule, Deldan Namgya erected the golden Buddha at Shey.

               Ladakh region witnesses summer season between the months of April and September and this is the best time to visit Ladakh. This is the time when Ladakh experiences sunny days and the temperature lies around 20 to 30 degree Celsius.  The views are lovely and clear, and the nights are very pleasant. In the summer months, the two road approaches to Ladakh, the Srinagar-Leh Highway and the Manali-Leh Highway get cleared of snow and become motorable. Ladakh is visited by tourists and trekkers alike during this time. Along with sightseeing, one can also partake in adventure activities. The rains are occasional. From November to March, the place experiences heavy snowfall and becomes inaccessible by road. However, during the winter months, Ladakh can be accessed by air and is visited by a trekking enthusiasts as it is quite popular for its winter treks. The temperature goes below zero degrees many time and the weather is extremely chilly.
               The Ladakh Festival organized on a large scale is now a regular tourist event on the tourist calendar. There are several schemes to promote tourism to the Ladakh region. These include opening up of inner line areas such as the beautiful Pangong Tso lake on the Indo-China border, Baima, whose villagers trace their descent to the early Aryan settlers and Nubra Valley which is situated near the strategic Siachen glacier on the Indo-Pak border. Along with the Ladakh festival, adventure tourism will figure prominently in the tourism package. A white water river rafting expedition along the 26-kilometre stretch from Fhey to Nimo along the mighty Indus River is a thrilling experience. It the highest point where river rafting is possible in the world. The high altitude and mountains make it an ideal spot for paragliding, mountaineering, trekking and even skiing. The Ladakhis are keen sportsmen and archery contests are frequently arranged at the village level, which draws all aspiring marksmen. Another popular game, polo, is played with great gusto reminiscent of the Mongol horsemen. The no holds-barred, robust game is far removed from the watered down version seen in today's polo circuits
               Visitors to Skara village near Leh are treated to a local archery contest. As the contestants draw bow and arrow, bowls filled with the delectable apricot, apple and dry fruits are served to the visitors followed by chang, a heady brew made of barley and gur tea, a regional favorite. There is a change of scene as the Festival shifts to the Nubra Valley. The sleepy pastoral countryside of Nubra which has recently been thrown open to tourism is located on the Indo-Pak border. A trip by helicopter over flies an intricate network of mountains including the Khardungla Pass, the highest motor able pass in the world. The mountains have a reddish hue.

Nubra boasts of a more liberal and progressive attitude having been on the ancient silk route and thus open to outside influence. The people are educated and speak fluent Hindi. Nubra is also the home of the double humped Bactrian camel rarely seen elsewhere in Ladakh. It is in Nubra that one sees the co-existence of water, mountain and desert-a rare sight. But then as many will testify, Ladakh is indeed a rare destination.

Ladakh covers about 45,000 square miles (117,000 square km) and contains the Ladakh Range, which is a southeastern extension of the Karakoram Range, and the upper Indus River valley. Ladakh is one of the highest regions of the world. Its natural features consist mainly of high plains and deep valleys. The high plain predominates in the east, diminishing gradually toward the west. In southeastern Ladakh lies Rupshu, an area of large, brackish lakes with a uniform elevation of about 13,500 feet (4,100 metres). To the northwest of Rupshu lies the Zaskar Range, an inaccessible region where the people and the cattle remain indoors for much of the year because of the cold. Zaskar is drained by the Zaskar River, which, flowing northward, joins the Indus River below Leh. In the heart of Ladakh, farther to the north, cultivation by means of manuring and irrigation is practiced by farmers living in valley villages at elevations between about 9,000 and 15,000 feet (2,750 and 4,550 metres). Shepherds tend flocks in the upland valleys that are too high for cultivation. Leh, the most accessible town of Ladakh, is an important trade centre located 160 miles (260 km) east of Srinagar.

                The climate of Ladakh is cold and dry. Average annual precipitation is roughly 3 inches (80 mm); fine, dry, flaked snow is frequent and sometimes falls heavily. Vegetation is confined to valleys and sheltered spots, where a stunted growth of tamarisk (genus Tamarix) shrubs, furze (also called gorse; spiny plants of the legume family), and other plants supply much-needed firewood. The principal products are wheat, barley, millet, buckwheat, peas, beans, and turnips. Woolen cloth and other textiles are the primary manufactures.


Ladakh has been contested by India and Pakistan since the dissolution of British India in 1947; after the cease-fire agreement of 1949, its southeastern portion went to India and the remainder to Pakistan. China gained control of its portion of Ladakh when its forces entered the region in the early 1960s.
