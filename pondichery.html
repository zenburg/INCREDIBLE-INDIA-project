<p>The Union Territory of Puducherry consists of four small unconnected districts: Puducherry district (293 km2 or 113 sq mi), Karaikal district (161 km2 or 62 sq mi) and Yanam district (20 km2 or 7.7 sq mi) on the Bay of Bengal and Mahé district (9 km2 or 3.5 sq mi) on the Laccadive Sea, covering a total area of 483 km2 (186 sq mi). Puducherry and Karai<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">kal have the largest areas and population, and are both enclaves of Tamil Nadu. Yanam and Mahé are enclaves of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, respectively. Its population, as per the 2011 Census, is 1,244,464.

Some of Puducherry's regions are themselves amalgamations of non-contiguous enclaves, often called "pockets" in India. The Puducherry region is made of 11 such pockets, some of which are very small and entirely surrounded by the territory of Tamil Nadu. Mahé region is made up of three pockets. This unusual geography is a legacy of the colonial period with Puducherry retaining the borders of former French India.

All four regions of Puducherry are located in the coastal region. Five rivers in Puducherry district, seven in Karaikal district, two in Mahé district and one in Yanam district drain into the sea, but none originates within the territory.</span></p>

<p>The culture of Pondicherry is diverse and vibrant. The city has a strong influence of French culture. Each year, the Mask Festival is celebrated in March, when people make merry by dressing in fancy costumes and masks. Sri Aurobindo’s birth anniversary is celebrated on the 15th of August, when devotees flock to the ashram and pay homag<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">e to his soul. It is also the site where International Yoga Festival is held every year. Bastille Day is another popular festival, where French war martyrs are honoured. \n\nWhen it comes to music and dance, Indian classical dance forms such as Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi are very famous. Tamilians in Pondicherry follow the tradition of beautiful figures at their doorsteps, called ‘Kolam’. Even the craftworks in Pondicherry reflect Tamil and French cultures. ‘Puducheri bommai’ is a type of handcrafted doll and ‘kowai’ mats are made from a particular type of grass, grown locally. In the restaurants and bakeries of Pondicherry, you can find traditional Tamil cuisine, as well as French pastries, brioches and baguettes.

<p>Pondicherry is the capital city of The Union Territory of Puducherry and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in South India.

A French colony until 1954, this coastal town retains a number of colonial buildings, churches, statues, and systematic town planning, as well as urban architecture of the local Tamil style. As such the town has been dubbed "The Europe of India". The to<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">wn struggles to preserve what little remains of the ambiance once created by this unique mix of cultural heritage.[1] It nevertheless draws tourists from around the world and from across India. Pondicherry is also a popular weekend destination, which can be reached easily from the nearby cities such as Chennai and Bangalore, principally because lower taxation on alcoholic beverages makes drinking in the Union Territory enclave much less expensive than in neighboring states
