                Chandigarh its name “The City Beautiful” says it all, it is one of the cleanest and well-developed cities of India.
                Chandigarh is a city, district and union territory in India that serves as the capital of the two neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana. The city is unique as it is not a part of either of the two states but is governed directly by the Union Government, which administers all such territories in the country.
                Chandigarh serves as the capital of two states Haryana and Punjab and is Union territory in India which is under the direct control of the Central Government. Chandigarh is located at foothills of Shivalik and has Punjab in the north and Haryana in the east.

                The name Chandigarh is formed from goddess name Chandi and Garh means a fortress. It is derived from the Hindu goddess ancient temple Chandi Mandir which is located in Panchkula. Chandigarh is also referred to as “The city beautiful” because of the beautiful architecture and urban design used to build it.


 
               Chandigarh is the master plan of a Swiss-French Architect Le Corbusier. Le Corbusier conceived the master plan of Chandigarh as analogous to human body, with a clearly defined head (the Capitol Complex, Sector 1), heart (the City Centre, Sector 17), lungs (the leisure valley, innumerable open spaces and sector greens), the intellect (the cultural and educational institutions), the circulatory system (the network of roads, the 7 Vs) and the viscera (the Industrial Area).  Chandigarh beside being beautiful is also the cleanest city in India based on National Government study. Mohali, Panchkula and Chandigarh is referred to as Tri-city.

                <h1>History of Chandigarh</h1>
                Chandigarh came into limelight during partition in 1947. The early capital of Punjab was Lahore which falls in Pakistan Territory,  but after partition, the province of Punjab was split between East Punjab in India and West Punjab in Pakistan. Th divided East Punjab needed a new capital and three regions Ludhiana, Ambala and Chandigarh were nominated for the same. But Chandigarh was chosen as it was farthest from the Pakistan border.

                The Government of Punjab in 1949 tasked an American planner and architect Albert Mayer to design the new city Chandigarh and later on Le Corbusier was appointed for the same. Le Corbusier designed many administration building including the High Court, the palace of Assembly and the Secteriate building and also designed the general layout plan of city dividing it into sectors.

               On November 1966, a newly formed state of Haryana was carved out from East Punjab. Majority of people living there were speaking Haryanavi so the eastern portion of East Punjab was called Haryana and while the western portion of East Punjab retains all the Punjabi speaking majority so called as Punjab.

               Chandigarh was located at the border of both the states and both of them try to incorporate Chandigarh in their territory. However, the city Chandigarh was declared as a union territory which now serves as capital to both the states.

                <div><img src="g&c2.jpg"  width="400" height="240"></div>
                Chandigarh has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cwa) characterised by a seasonal rhythm: very hot summers, mild winters, unreliable rainfall and great variation in temperature (−1 °C to 46 °C OR 30.2 °F to 114 °F). The average annual rainfall is 1110.7 mm.[33] The city also receives occasional winter rains from the Western Disturbance originating over the Mediterranean Sea.

                The western disturbances usually bring rain predominantly from mid-December till end of April which can be heavier sometimes with strong winds and hails if the weather turns colder (during March–April months) which usually proves disastrous to the crops. Cold winds usually tend to come from the north near Shimla, capital of Himachal Pradesh and from the state of Jammu and Kashmir, both of which receive their share of snowfall during wintertime.

                The city experiences the following seasons and the respective average temperatures:

               Spring: The climate remains the most enjoyable part of the year during the spring season (from February-end to early-April). Temperatures vary between (max) 13 °C to 20 °C and (min) 5 °C to 12 °C.
               Autumn: In autumn (from September-end to mid-November), the temperature may rise to a maximum of 30 °C. Temperatures usually remain between 10° to 22° in autumn. The minimum temperature is around 6 °C.
               Summer: The temperature in summer (from mid-April to June-end) may rise to 44 °C. The temperatures might sometime rise to 44 °C in mid-June. Temperatures generally vary between 40 and 42 °C.
               Monsoon: During the monsoon (from early-July to mid-September), Chandigarh receives moderate to heavy rainfall and sometimes heavy to very heavy rainfall (generally during the month of August or September). Usually, the rain-bearing monsoon winds blow from south-west/south-east. Mostly, the city receives heavy rain from the south (which is mainly a persistent rain) but it generally receives most of its rain during monsoon either from northwest or northeast. The maximum amount of rain received by the city of Chandigarh during monsoon season is 195.5 mm in a single day.
               Winter: Winters (November-end to February-end) are mild but they can sometimes get quite chilly in Chandigarh.
