        <h1><span>Welcome to</span> NAGALAND</h1>
          <p>  Nagaland  is bordered by the state of Arunachal Pradesh to the north, Assam to the west, Manipur to the
             south and the Sagaing Region of Myanmar to the east. Nagaland's capital city is Kohima and its largest city
             is Dimapur. It has an area of 16,579 square kilometres (6,401 sq mi) with a population of 1,980,602 per the 
             2011 Census of India, making it one of the smallest states of India.

                <td><h2>Geographical</h2>
                   <p>Nagaland is largely a mountainous state. The Naga Hills rise from the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam 
                     to about 610 metres (2,000 ft) and rise further to the southeast, as high as 1,800 metres (6,000 ft).
                      Mount Saramati at an elevation of 3,841.00 metres (12,601.70 ft) is the state's highest peak; 
                      this is where the Naga Hills merge with the Patkai Range in which form the boundary with Burma.
                     Rivers such as the Doyang and Diphu to the north, the Barak river in the southwest, dissect the entire state.
                     20 percent of the total land area of the state is covered with wooded forest, a haven for flora and fauna.

                   <p>The ancient history of the Nagas is unclear. They migrated at different times, each settling in the
                      northeastern part of present India and establishing their respective sovereign mountain terrains and
                     village-states. There are no records of whether they came from the northern Mongolian region, 
                     southeast Asia or southwest China, except that their origins are from the east of India and that
                     historical records show the present-day Naga people settled before the arrival of the Ahoms in 1228 AD.

                      Kuki, Lotha, Phom, Pochury, Rengma, Sangtam, Sumi, Yimchunger, and Zeliang. The Angamis, Aos, Konyaks, Lothas,

                       Tribe and clan traditions and loyalties play an important part in the life of Nagas.
