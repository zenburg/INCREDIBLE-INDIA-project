                <h1>History of Uttar Pradesh</h1>
               The history of Uttar Pradesh can be divided into five periods: (1) prehistory and mythology (up to c. 600 BCE), (2) the Buddhist-Hindu period (c. 600 BCE to c. 1200 CE), (3) the Muslim period (c. 1200 to c. 1775), (4) the British period (c. 1775 to 1947), and (5) the postindependence period (1947 to the present). Because of its position in the heart of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, it has often been the focal point in the history of all of northern India.
               A systematic history of India and the area of Uttar Pradesh dates to the end of the 7th century BCE, when 16 mahajanapadas (great states) in northern India were contending for supremacy. Of those, seven fell entirely within the present-day boundaries of Uttar Pradesh. From the 5th century BCE to the 6th century CE, the region was mostly under the control of powers centred outside the modern boundaries of the state, first at Magadha in present-day Bihar and later at Ujjain in present-day Madhya Pradesh. Among the great kings who ruled over the region were Chandragupta (reigned c. 321–297 BCE) and Ashoka (3rd century BCE), both Mauryan emperors, as well as Samudra Gupta (4th century CE) and Chandra Gupta II (reigned c. 380–415). A later famous ruler, Harsha (reigned c. 606–647), was based within the state’s present borders. From his capital at Kanyakubja (present-day Kannauj), he was able to control the whole of Uttar Pradesh as well as parts of what are now Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and Rajasthan.
