                The smallest state of India needs no introduction because this honeypot tourist destination attracts over 63 hundred thousand visitors every year! A former Portuguese colony, Goa is also fondly known as the 'Rome of the East'. Goa as we know it is exactly how anyone in the country would describe it too, beaches, endless parties, exciting nightlife and surreal nature at its best. Inhabited and colonized by the Portuguese for almost 450 years, the state has an inherent influence on their culture and traditions. Spawned over a land area of 3702 km square with the Arabian Sea cradling its coastline, this destination experiences tropic weather conditions almost all through the year. Since everyone already knows of Goa's colourful nightlife, here is a little throwback to the rich history that the state also boasts of.

                <h1>History of Goa</h1>
                Besides being colonized by the Portuguese, Goa has a fascinating historical past, which dates back further to the 3rd century BC. A prominent part of the Mauryan Empire, Goa was of prime importance because of its natural harbours and wide river base. Only in 1987 did Goa get the status of an independent state and the regional language Konkani was recognized as one of India's official languages. Despite the multi-cultural influences on Goa, the state still boasts of a distinctive culture, which makes the destination an affable one.

                The state of Goa, in India, is famous for its beaches and places of worship. Tourism is its primary industry, and is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist activity inland.

                Foreign tourists, mostly from Europe, arrive in Goa in winter, whilst the summer and monsoon seasons see many Indian tourists. Goa handled 2.29% of all foreign tourist arrivals in the country in 2011. This relatively small state is situated on the west coast of India, between the borders of Maharashtra and Karnataka, and is better known to the world as a former Portuguese enclave on Indian soil. Thus, Tourism forms the backbone of Goa's economy.

                Influenced by over 450 years of Portuguese rule and Latin culture, Goa presents a somewhat different representation of the country to foreign visitors. Major tourist attractions include: Bom Jesus Basilica, Fort Aguada, a wax museum on Indian culture, and a heritage museum. The Churches and Convents of Goa have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

                As of 2013, Goa was the destination of choice for Indian and foreign tourists, particularly Britons, with limited means who wanted to party. The state was hopeful that changes could be made which would attract a more upscale demographic.
