                 Mizoram is an adorning state glamoured with scenic spots and vibrant cultural entity. Based mainly on the tribal communities inhabiting this alluring state, referred to as the Mizos, the cultural boundary of Mizoram is reflective in its own way. Known as the land of diverse tribes and races of people living together, the different tribes and communities here have unique features of their own. The festivals exhibit the vast cultural diversity of the state. The festival season is the season of harvest. The festivals are celebrated with great vigour and enthusiasm. Festivals thus play a major role in shaping the brotherhood bonds of the tribes, also helping them to perform their old traditions and rituals while renewing some old bonds and ties. Each tribe has its own festival and rituals.

                <h1>History of Mizoram</h1>
                Little is known of Mizoram’s early history. Between 1750 and 1850 the Mizo (formerly called Lushai) tribes migrated from the nearby Chin Hills, subjugated the indigenous peoples, and assimilated them into their own society. The Mizo developed an autocratic political system based on some 300 hereditary chieftanships.

The tribes of Mizoram remained unaffected by foreign political influence until the British annexed Assam in 1826 under the Treaty of Yandabo. During the next decades, Mizo raids into British territory led to occasional punitive expeditions by the British. By the 1870s the region had come under British control. In 1873 it fell under the Inner Line Regulations of the British administration, which prohibited the movement of people from the plains into the hills. However, the region was not formally annexed until the early 1890s.

The region initially was administered as the North Lushai Hills (in the province of Assam) and the South Lushai Hills (within the Bengal Presidency). In 1898 the region was united as the Lushai Hills District of Assam. The district was declared an “excluded area” in 1935, whereby the provincial legislature was stripped of its jurisdiction over the area, and responsibility for the district’s administration was placed directly in the hands of the governor of Assam.

               Mizoram is a state in the northeast of India. Mizoram is considered by many as a beautiful place due to its dramatic landscape and pleasant climate. There have been many attempts to increase revenue through tourism but many potential tourists find the lack of amenities to be a hurdle. However, the State continues to promote itself and many projects have been initiated. The tourism ministry continues to maintain or upgrade its tourist lodges throughout the state. Foreign tourists are required to obtain an 'inner line permit' under the special permit before visiting. The permit can be obtained from Indian missions abroad for a limited number of days or direct from Mizoram Government authorities within India. The state is rich in bird diversity, which has the potentiality to make it a major birding destination. For Mrs Hume's pheasant (Syrmaticus humiae), Mizoram is a stronghold. There is also a rare record of the wild water buffalo from the state. There are several past records of the Sumatran rhinoceros from Mizoram, then Lushai Hills. The small population of wild elephants can be seen in Ngengpui and Dampa Sanctuaries. Some of the interesting sites are Mizo Poets' Square also known as Mizo Hlakungpui Mual in Mizo, the Great Megaliths locally known as 'Kawtchhuah Ropui'.

                <h1>Geography and climate</h1>
                <div><img src="g&c1.jpg"  width="400" height="240"></div>
                Geologically, the Mizo Hills form a part of the Rakhine (Arakan) Mountains, a series of compact parallel ridges with a north-south axis formed of sandstone, limestone, and shales—all Cenozoic rocks between 2.6 and 65 million years old. The ridges, separated by narrow river valleys, rise to about 7,000 feet (2,100 metres). In the south, the Kaladan River and its tributaries flow southward into Myanmar, while the Dhaleswari (Tlawng) and Sonai (Tuirail) rivers flow north into Assam.More than three-fourths of the land area of Mizoram is forested. Thick evergreen forests contain valuable timber trees, such as champak (Michelia champaca), ironwood, and gurjun (genus Dipterocarpus). The woodlands also provide habitat for many animals, including elephants, tigers, bears, deer, monkeys, gibbons, and serows (wild goatlike mammals). Such animals are protected in a number of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.

                The climate in Mizoram is moderate. During the coolest months (November through February), temperatures in Aizawl typically rise from the low 50s (low 10s C) into the high 60s F (about 20 °C) daily. In the warmest months (June through August), minimum temperatures are in the high 60s F, while maximum temperatures usually peak in the mid-80s F (about 30 °C). Rainfall averages about 100 inches (2,500 mm) annually, with most brought by the southwest monsoon (which blows from May to September).
