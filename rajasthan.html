Rajasthan is located on the northwestern side of India, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the "Great Indian Desert") and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus river valley. Elsewhere it is bordered by five other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest.

                <h1>History of Rajasthan</h1>
                Parts of what is now Rajasthan were partly part of the Vedic Civilisation and Indus Valley Civilization. Kalibangan, in Hanumangarh district, was a major provincial capital of the Indus Valley Civilization.[17] Another archaeological excavation at Balathal site in Udaipur district shows a settlement contemporary with the Harrapan civilisation dating back to 3000 – 1500 BC.

                Stone Age tools dating from 5,000 to 200,000 years were found in Bundi and Bhilwara districts of the state.[18]

                Matsya Kingdom of the Vedic civilisation of India, is said to roughly corresponded to the former state of Jaipur in Rajasthan and included the whole of Alwar with portions of Bharatpur.[19][20] The capital of Matsya was at Viratanagar (modern Bairat), which is said to have been named after its founder king Virata.[21][need quotation to verify]

                Bhargava[22] identifies the two districts of Jhunjhunu and Sikar and parts of Jaipur district along with Haryana districts of Mahendragarh and Rewari as part of Vedic state of Brahmavarta. Bhargava also locates the present day Sahibi River as the Vedic Drishadwati River, which along with Saraswati River formed the borders of the Vedic state of Brahmavarta.[23] Manu and Bhrigu narrated the Manusmriti to a congregation of seers in this area only. Ashrams of Vedic seers Bhrigu and his son Chayvan Rishi, for whom Chyawanprash was formulated, were near Dhosi Hill part of which lies in Dhosi village of Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan and part lies in Mahendragarh district of Haryana.

                <div><img src="c1.jpg"  width="400" height="240"></div>
                ajasthan is culturally rich and has artistic and cultural traditions that reflect the ancient Indian way of life. There is rich and varied folk culture from villages which are often depicted as a symbol of the state. Highly cultivated classical music and dance with its own distinct style is part of the cultural tradition of Rajasthan. The music has songs that depict day-to-day relationships and chores, often focused around fetching water from wells or ponds.[64]

                Rajasthani cooking was influenced by both the war-like lifestyles of its inhabitants and the availability of ingredients in this arid region. Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. The scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. It is known for its snacks like Bikaneri Bhujia. Other famous dishes include bajre ki roti (millet bread) and lahsun ki chutney (hot garlic paste), mawa kachori Mirchi Bada, Pyaaj Kachori and ghevar from Jodhpur, Alwar ka Mawa (milk cake), Kadhi kachori from Ajmer, malpauas from Pushkar, Daal kachori (Kota kachori) from Kota and rassgollas from Bikaner. Originating from the Marwar region of the state is the concept of Marwari Bhojnalaya, or vegetarian restaurants, today found in many parts of India, which offer vegetarian food of the Marwari people.

                Dal-Bati-Churma is very popular in Rajasthan. The traditional way to serve it is to first coarsely mash the Baati, and then pour pure ghee on top of it. It is served with the daal (lentils) and spicy garlic chutney. Also served with besan (gram flour) ki kadi. It is commonly served at all festivities, including religious occasions, wedding ceremonies, and birthday parties in Rajasthan.

                <div><img src="c2.jpg"  width="400" height="240"></div>
                The climate in India keeps varying as per the latitude, altitude and season. Now, coming to Rajasthan, the climate here keeps varying because of its topography. It is the driest region in India. Rajasthan is located in the north western part of India and thus, it is more prone to different climatic changes. While the western part of Rajasthan is dry and infertile, the southwestern part is hilly and wet.

                The climate of Rajasthan keeps varying throughout the state. In the desert areas, it is usually hot and dry in summer and cold during the winters. Coming to the Aravali range, to the west, both rainfall and humidity are low. While to the east, weather can be characterized by high humidity and better rainfall. Below, we have further discussed about the climate in Rajasthan by dividing it into four seasons: Summer, Monsoon, Post-Monsoon and Winter.

                Summer

                The hottest of all seasons, summer extends in Rajasthan from April to June. During summers, the temperature in Rajasthan is very high and it ranges somewhere between 32 degree Celsius and 46 degree Celsius. The place has an average temperature of 38 degree Celsius. The only place in the state which has a lower temperature during this season is Mt Abu. At day, hot winds blow from the west and these winds are called ‘Loo’.
