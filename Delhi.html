             of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India.It is bordered by the state of Haryana on three 
             sides and by Uttar Pradesh to the east. Delhi is of great historical significance as an important
            commercial, transport, and cultural hub, as well as the political centre of India. 
            According to legend, the city was named for Raja Dhilu, a king who reigned in the region in the 1st

                   <p>The area around Delhi was probably inhabited before the second millennium BCE and there is evidence of 
                     continuous inhabitation since at least the 6th century BCE.The city is believed to be the site of Indraprastha, 
                     the legendary capital of the Pandavas in the Indian epic Mahabharata.
                     According to the Mahabharata, this land was initially a huge mass of forests called 'Khandavaprastha' which
                     was burnt down to build the city of Indraprastha. The earliest architectural relics date back to the Maurya 
                     period (c. 300 BCE); in 1966, an inscription of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (273â€“235 BCE) was discovered near 
                     Srinivaspuri. Remains of several major cities can be found in Delhi. The first of these were in the southern 
                     part of present-day Delhi. King Anang Pal of the Tomara dynasty founded the city of Lal Kot in 736 CE. 
                     Prithviraj Chauhan conquered Lal Kot in 1178 and renamed it Qila Rai Pithora.

                <td><h2>Cultural</h2>
                    <p>Delhi's culture has been influenced by its lengthy history and historic association as the capital of India,
                       Although a strong Punjabi Influence can be seen in language, Dress and Cuisine brought by the large number of 
                       refugees who came following the partition in 1947 the recent migration from other parts of India has made it 
                       a melting pot. This is exemplified by many significant monuments in the city. Delhi is also identified as the
                        location of Indraprastha, the ancient capital of the Pandavas. 
                        The Archaeological Survey of India recognises 1,200 heritage buildings and 175 monuments as national heritage sites.
