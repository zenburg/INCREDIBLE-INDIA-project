        <h1><span>Welcome to</span> LAKSHADWEEP</h1>
          <p> Lakshadweep, the group of 36 islands is known for its exotic and sun-kissed beaches and lush green
             landscape. The name Lakshadweep in Malayalam and Sanskrit means 'a hundred thousand islands'.
             All Islands are 220 to 440 km away from the coastal city of Kochi in Kerala, in the emerald Arabian Sea.                      
             Lakshadweep is an archipelago of twelve atolls, three reefs and five submerged banks, with a total of about
             thirty-nine islands and islets. The reefs are in fact also atolls, although mostly submerged, with only small
             unvegetated sand cays above the high-water mark. The submerged banks are sunken atolls. 
             Almost all the atolls have a northeast–southwest orientation with the islands lying on the eastern rim.

                   <p>Lakshadweep is an archipelago of twelve atolls, three reefs and five submerged banks, with a total of about thirty-nine islands and islets. 
                     The reefs are in fact also atolls, although mostly submerged, with only small unvegetated sand cays above the high-water mark. 
                     The submerged banks are sunken atolls. Almost all the atolls have a northeast–southwest orientation with the islands lying on the eastern 
                     rim, and a mostly submerged reef on the western rim, enclosing a lagoon. It has ten inhabited islands, 17 uninhabited islands, 
                     attached islets, four newly formed islets and five submerged reefs.
                      The main islands are Kavaratti, Agatti, Minicoy, and Amini. The total population of the territory is 60,595 according to the
                      2001 census. Agatti has an airport with direct flights from Kochi.

                   <p>One of the earliest references to the region is by an anonymous author in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.
                    There are references to the control of the islands by the Cheras in the Sangam Patiṟṟuppattu. 
                    Local traditions and legends attribute the first settlement on these islands to the period of Cheraman 
                    Perumal, the last Chera king of Kerala.[6] The oldest inhabited islands in the group are Amini, Kalpeni 
                    Andrott, Kavaratti, and Agatti. Archaeological evidence suggests that Buddhism prevailed in the region 
                    during the fifth and sixth centuries AD. According to popular tradition, Islam was brought to Lakshadweep by
                    Ubaidullah in AD 661. His grave is located on the island of Andrott. During the 11th century, the islands 
                    came under the rule of the Late Cholas and subsequently the Kingdom of Cannanore.

                <td><h2>Cultural</h2>
                    <p>The culture of the Lakshadweep group is quite rich. There are many types of practices and traditions here. 
                      People of the religion, Islam live in this region, but here people of other religions also get to see festivals
                      and dances. The earlier inhabitants of Lakshadweep were Hindus who had migrated from the Malabar coast of Kerala and 
                      converted to Islam in the 7th century. It is said that a person named Ubedullah has made a big contribution 
                      in bringing Islam religion here.Due to Lakshadweep being close to Kerala, there is a lot of influence on the tradition
                      and tradition of Kerala. Festivals like Muharram, Bakri Eid, Miladunnabi, and Eid ul Fitr are celebrated with great 
                      enthusiasm here.

                     The people of Kavaratti are considerably skilled stone masons and carpenters.
                      Although the boat building industry has suffered, traditional skills still exist in some parts of the islands.
                     Coir-based industries are also one of the oldest occupations. A tuna canning factory is located in Minicoy. </p>
