               There are some 40 tribes in Chhattisgarh, making up almost a third of the population, with most concentrated around the forests of Bastar. That makes this central Indian state one of the best places in the country to experience firsthand, little-known, historic cultural practices and ways of life. But because tourism in Chhattisgarh remains as yet undeveloped compared to other parts of India, there are distinct advantages to travelling with local guides, and specialist tour operators that have spent years building up relationships and trust in these communities.

                <h1>History of Chhattisgarh</h1>
                The name Chhattisgarh is not ancient and has come into popular usage in the last
                few centuries. In ancient times the region was called Dakshin Kosala. All inscriptions,
                literary works and the accounts of foreign travelers, call this region Kosala of Dakshin
                Kosala. According to Hari Thakur, the contest between Jabalpur and Chhattisgarh for the
                name Mahakosala is settled beyond doubt in favour of Chhattisgarh in the light of available
                evidence.
                Even during the reign of the Mughals, it was called Ratanpur territory and not
                Chhattisgarh. The word Chhattisgarh was popularized during the Maratha period and was
                first used in an official document in 1795.
