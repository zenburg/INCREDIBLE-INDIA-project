                <h1>History of Dadra and Nagar Haveli</h1>
               The history of Dadra and Nagar Haveli before India’s medieval period (roughly 11th–16th century CE) remains obscure. In 1262 CE a Rajput invader defeated the local Koli chieftains of the area and became the ruler of Ramnagar, a small state that included Nagar Haveli in its territory. The region remained under Rajput rule until the mid-18th century, when the Marathas acquired Nagar Haveli.

Dadra and Nagar Haveli came under the rule of Portugal in the late 18th century. The Marathas ceded Nagar Haveli to the Portuguese in 1783 as compensation for a Portuguese vessel that their navy had destroyed. Two years later Portugal acquired Dadra, which became a kind of fief. After India achieved independence in 1947, nationalists in Goa—the oldest Portuguese possession in India—sought to break away from Portugal; their first successes were the seizure of Dadra on the night of July 21, 1954, and their capture of Nagar Haveli two weeks later. A pro-Indian administration was formed in these enclaves, and on June 1, 1961, Dadra and Nagar Haveli requested accession to the Indian union. Although the Indian government had already acknowledged the incorporation of the two areas after their liberation from the Portuguese, their status as a single union territory was made official on Aug. 11, 1961.
