                <h1>History of Karnataka</h1>
              Karnataka history can be traced back to the Pre-historic period. Karnataka is said to be one of the four Dravidian states associated with Indus-Valley civilization. Aryans from central Asia invaded the Dravidic city-state and civilized and colonized it.

Archaeologists have discovered artifacts dating back to 5000 B.C.E. It has many sites of Pre-historic period and most of them are found scattered on the river valleys of Krishna, Bhima, Malaprabha, Ghataprabha, Cauvery, Hemavathi, Shimsha, Tungabhadra, Manjra, Pennar, Netravati, etc and their tributaries.

Pre-historic studies in India started with the discovery of ash mounds at Kupgal and Kudatini in 1836 by a British Officer in the Bellary region, which then formed part of Madras presidency. Subsequent discoveries have revealed the existence of a stone-age man with innumerable Pre-historic sites in Karnataka.

The Pre-historic culture of Karnataka viz. the hand-ax culture, compares favorably with the one that existed in Africa and is quite distinct from the Pre-historic culture of North India.
